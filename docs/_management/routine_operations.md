# Routine Operations

## Administrative Web User Interface

### Troubleshoot ontology submissions: Ontologies tab

See the [Troubleshooting Submissions](../../ontologies/troubleshooting_submissions) page
for detailed instructions on troubleshooting ontology submissions.

See the [Managing Ontologies](../../ontologies/managing_ontologies) page 
to learn more about basic operations like updating ontology metadata, deleting ontologies,
and reparsing ontologies.

#### How can I clear the memcached-based UI cache?

If you are logged in as the admin user, simply visit http://{your_appliance_ip_or_domain_name}/admin and click the "Flush Memcache" button. There should be a response indicating success or failure.
