# Troubleshooting Submissions

Here we describe how to troubleshoot issues with ontology submissions. 
As with all the troubleshooting sections, 
this section will be enhanced based on experiences with the deployed OntoPortal systems.

For troubleshooting installations, see the <a href="../../steps/troubleshooting_installations">Troubleshooting Installations</a> section.

For troubleshooting system operations, see the <a href="../../management/troubleshooting_operations">Troubleshooting Operations</a> section.
