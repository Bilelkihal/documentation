## About UMLS content

## Converting UMLS content
UMLS ontologies can be processed to work with our system by converting them to RDF. 

There is no automated way to do this and you must have your own UMLS MySQL installation and an OSX/Linux/Unix machine with 8GB+ of RAM in order for the conversion process to work. The scripts to convert UMLS to RDF are available on Github.

Once you have converted UMLS to RDF, you will get Turtle (.ttl) files that can be uploaded using the BioPortal Web UI. Please select UMLS as the format for these ontologies.
