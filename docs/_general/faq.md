# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can I use the Annotator and Recommender on their own?

Because services like the Annotator and Recommender 
depend on the Ontologies API in BioPortal, 
you can not usefully install those services in a stand-alone way 
without also installing the core BioPortal software and ontologies.

## Under what license is the OntoPortal Virtual Appliance released?

The OntoPortal source code delivered with the Virtual Appliance is released 
under a 2-clause BSD license. 

Software from other organizations, such as the AllegroGraph graph database, 
is released using the license included with that software. 

The software used to package the OntoPortal system for distribution 
is not publicly available. 
Users must obtain a license to use the packaged system.
Members of the {{site.opa}} have access to and maintain the packaging software.
