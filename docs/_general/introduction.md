The OntoPortal Virtual Appliance is a copy of the BioPortal software 
that you can run on your own Linux system. 
You can install it following the instructions in this manual, 
and upload your own ontologies (and/or copies of ours, if they are public).

The OntoPortal Virtual Appliance image contains a pre-installed, pre-configured version 
of commonly-used open source software running on a Linux operating system.

It is available as a VMWare Virtual Appliance OVF, as well as an Amazon Web Service AMI, 
and can be obtained by contacting us following the instructions under Getting Started in this manual.

The following software is included on the image as of v3.0:

* Ontologies API (REST service)
* Annotator
* Ontology Recommender
* OntoPortal Web User Interface (including UIs for ontology browse, Annotator and Recommender, ontology tree visualization, graph visualization with BioMixer, and widgets)
* API services

Please see the rest of this manual for how-to documentation 
for managing the software and running data population for Annotator and Recommender.
