<h1>Managing Your System</h1>

The {{site.opva}} requires some routine operational monitoring, 
occasional troubleshooting or corrective actions (more often if heavily used),
and occasional tasks at very infrequent intervals.
In this section we describe how to perform these tasks for the Appliance.

<div>
{% assign sorted_ops = (site.management | sort: 'weight') %}

{% for operation in sorted_ops %}

	<div style="padding: 10px;">
		<div style="font-weight: bold;">
			<a href="{{site.baseurl}}{{operation.url}}">{{operation.title}}</a>
		</div>

		<div>
				{{operation.description}}
		</div>
	</div>
{% endfor %}

</div>
