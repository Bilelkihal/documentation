### VMWare Virtual Appliance

To obtain the VMWare Virtual Appliance, contact OntoPortal Support to initiate your request. 
You'll then be asked privately for your BioPortal account username, project goals, and reason for preferring the local installation.

If you don't have a BioPortal account, you can create one at: http://bit.ly/bioportal-account.
If your email doesn't include your organization or other means of identifying you, we will ask for that as well.
The overall transaction can take a few working days, depending on resource availability.
The download is provided as a zip archive containing several files. One of these is an Open Virtualization Format (OVF) file that may need to be converted to work in your virtualization environment.

You can supply the hostname (machine name) for the virtual machine during the deployment process. 
Documentation will refer to this hostname as 'example'.

an Amazon Machine Instance (AMI) is available on the BioOntology AWS Market Place. 
Please contact OntoPortal Support for more information.

The default application administrator is 'admin' and the initial password is the Instance ID. 
You can also SSH to the machine using the username 'ec2-user' and your Amazon private key.
