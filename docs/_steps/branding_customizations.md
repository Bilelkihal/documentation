# Branding Customizations

## Why brand your appliance?

If you're running a public version of the {{site.opva}}, 
you've probably already started to think about how to present your site.
Having a unique name, logo, and unifying colors lets users
recognize and associate good things with your site.
And it makes your site look good!

Even if you have a private ontology for your own research, 
just a few hours customizing its look and feel 
can help you distinguish it from BioPortal and other Appliances,
and can give your presented materials a distinctive presence.
Slides, web pages, and even papers can benefit from the colorful 
views of your OntoPortal Appliance content.
