# Getting Started

## Obtaining the OntoPortal Virtual Appliance

*(Needs rewrite for registration process)*

To obtain the VMWare Virtual Appliance, 
contact OntoPortal Support to initiate your request.
You'll then be asked privately for your BioPortal account username, project goals, and reason for preferring the local installation.

If you don't have a BioPortal account, you can create one at: http://bit.ly/bioportal-account.
If your email doesn't include your organization or other means of identifying you, 
we will ask for that as well.
The overall transaction can take a few working days, depending on resource availability.

The download is provided as a zip archive containing several files. 
One of these is an Open Virtualization Format (OVF) file 
that you may need to 
<a href="../virtualization_environment">convert for your virtualization environment</a>.

## Amazon AWS AMI

For users who want to run their OntoPortal instance on Amazon Web Services, 
an Amazon Machine Instance (AMI) is available on the BioOntology AWS Market Place. 


Once the instance is running, enter the public DNS provided by Amazon into your browser to access BioPortal web interface. 
The default application administrator is 'admin' and the initial password is the Instance ID. 
You can also SSH to the machine using the username 'ec2-user' and your Amazon private key.
